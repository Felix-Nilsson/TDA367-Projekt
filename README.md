# TDA367-Projekt

<h1> Alien Defense </h1>

WELCOME to our Tower Defense game known as Alien Defense!

This game was made by Felix Nilsson, Hannes Svahn, Oscar Forsyth, Jon Emilsson and Simon Larsson as a group project for TDA367/DIT212 at Chalmers.

To play the game simply run the jar file "AlienDefense-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar" in the "Alien Defense" directory either by command line or by clicking on the executable jar file if you have the correct settings for it.

This is our first big project for any of us and we've been working extremely hard on it to make it into somewhat of a game during the 8 weeks we had to complete this.
